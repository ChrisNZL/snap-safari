**!!! (18 Sep 2013) Please note: due to Safari being stupidly buggy, I've stopped supporting this Safari extension. I am still actively updating the Chromium version, however!**

Snap Usage Monitor extension for Safari
===========

[**Click here to download Snap Usage Monitor v0.0.3 for Mac OS X Safari**](https://github.com/ChrisNZL/snap-safari/raw/master/Builds/SnapUsageMonitor_0.0.3.safariextz) (67 KB)

If Snap is your ISP, this extension lets you view details of your data usage with the click of a button:
* Data used
* Data remaining
* Average daily usage
* Billing period estimate
* Suggested daily usage
* Time remaining
* Network status announcements

And a visual progress bar that displays:
* Percentage of data used towards your limit
* How far through the billing period you are

**Requires Safari 5.1 or higher.** (I've only tested this in Safari 5.1; my Mac is too old for Safari 6)

**Only works for Safari on Mac OS X. Safari on Windows is not supported.**
